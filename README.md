How to Open the Console on Any Website (If You Don’t Know)
On every website, you can try opening the console—some sites allow it, some don't. Just give it a try!

If you don’t know how to open the console, it’s simple:

Right-click anywhere on the website page and select Inspect.
A panel will open showing the Elements tab by default.
Find and click on the Console tab there.
If the site has any JavaScript code running in the console, you’ll see it or be able to interact with it.
If not, the console might be empty or disabled, so no worries!
